        <intro>
        	Maximum entropy modeling is a framework for integrating information
        	from many heterogeneous information sources for classification.
        	The data for a  classification problem is described as a (potentially large)
        	number of features.
        	
        	These features can be quite complex and allow the experimenter to make use
        	of prior knowledge about what types of informations are expected to be
        	important for classification. Each feature corresponds to a constraint on the model.
        	We then compute the maximum entropy model, the model with the maximum entropy of all
        	the models that satisfy the constraints.  This term may seem perverse, since we have
        	spent most of the book trying to minimize the (cross) entropy of models, but the idea
        	is that we do not want to go beyond the data.  If we chose a model with less entropy,
        	we would add `information' constraints to the model that are not justified by the
        	empirical evidence available to us. Choosing the maximum entropy model is motivated
        	by the desire to preserve as much uncertainty as possible.
